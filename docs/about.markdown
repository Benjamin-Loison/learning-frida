Android security is a topic of great interest to me and the dynamic instrumentation toolkit [Frida](https://frida.re) is an interesting tool that I've been wanting to learn more about. A good way to learn new tools is to actually use them, another is to teach others how to use them. On this blog I combine the two approaches by using Frida to solve various reverse engineering challenges and similar and writing about how I solve them.

I'm mainly working on a Windows computer, but might do some things on Linux as well. When I started this journey I had no experience at all with Frida. So even if you are completely new to Frida you should hopefully be able to follow along.

When you are ready, start your journey by [installing Frida]({% post_url 2020-05-15-installing-frida %}).
