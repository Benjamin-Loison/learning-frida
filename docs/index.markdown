Hi there!

Security in general, and Android security in particular is a topic of interest to me so [Frida](https://frida.re) is a tool that's caught my attention. To learn more about it's capabilities and how to use it, I'm solving various reverse engineering challenges using Frida and writing about it on this blog.

If you don't have any experience with Frida I suggest that you start with the first post ([Installing Frida]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-05-15-installing-frida %})), and continue from there.
